Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

* 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms

.. code-block:: python

    from itertools import takewhile
    from question import *

    def gen_fib():
        f0, f1 = 0, 1
        while True:
            yield f0
            f0, f1 = f1, f0+f1
                    
    limit = 4000000
    fibs = takewhile(lambda x: x <= limit, gen_fib())
    answer = sum(f for f in fibs if f % 2 == 0)
